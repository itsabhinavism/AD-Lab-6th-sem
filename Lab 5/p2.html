    <h2>Questions 2</h2>
    <p>
     Implement using JavaScript a Rock-Paper-Scissors game between a
player and the computer, where both will make a random selection of either Rock, Paper, or Scissors. Rock will beat out Scissors, Paper will beat out Rock, and Scissors
will beat out Paper. Use the following steps for your implementation of the game. 
1. Create an array that contains the variables Rock, Paper, and Scissors. 
2. Set up a variable that generates a random number 0-2 for the player and
then do the same for the computer's selection. The number represents the
index values in the array of the 3 items. 
3. Create a variable to hold a response message to the user. This can show the
random results for the player and then also the result for the computer of
the matching item from the array. 
4. Create a condition to handle the player and computer selections. If both are
the same, this results in a tie. 
5. Use conditions to apply the game logic and return the correct results. There
are several ways to do this with the condition statements, but you could
check which player's index value is bigger and assign the victory accordingly, with the exception of Rock beating Scissors. 6. Add a new output message that shows the player selection versus the
computer selection and the result of the game.
