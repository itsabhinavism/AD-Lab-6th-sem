        Implement a data structure for a product catalog using JavaScript and
create queries to retrieve data as per following specifications:
1. Create an array to hold an inventory of store items. 
2. Create three items, each having the properties of name, model, cost, and
quantity. 
3. Add all three objects to the main array using an array method, and then log
the inventory array to the console.
